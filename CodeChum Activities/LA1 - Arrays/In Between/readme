Hello there! I am a robot that was made to read and analyze numbers of all sorts. I’ve been doing simple operations for a while now and I think I’m ready to handle more difficult ones.

 

I want you to program to be able to analyze an array of integers and a value of x and y, and output those numbers in the array that are in between the values of x and y inclusive in the order from first input to last.

 

If there are no such numbers, output (none) instead.

Sample Output 1

Enter n: 5
Enter 5 elements: 15 28 64 75 51
Values of x and y: 50 90
Numbers in between = 64 75 51
