You are to implement a music streaming application that will have the following details:

 

A Song struct has a string title, at most 2 artists, a Boolean fave, and an integer counter of the number of times played. When this song has been played more than 5 times, this song should be set as favorite.

 

The playlist, implemented using doubly linked list with sentinels with a current song marker to indicate which song is currently played. Initially there are no songs and the user has to play the next song in order to play the first song.

 

The playlist shall have the following methods:

void addSong(Song* s)
Adds the song to the end of the playlist. If this song is initially a favorite, add this to the first part of the list at the end of the existing favorites.

Song* next()
Plays the next song in the list. Returns null if there are no next songs.

Song* previous()
Plays the previous song in the list. Returns null if there are no previous songs.

Song* play()
Plays the current song. Returns null if there is no current song.

Song* skip()
Reduces the play counter of the current song and plays the next song. Returns null if there are no next songs.

Song* skip(int n)
Reduces the play counter of the current song and skips n songs to play the next song. Returns the last song in the list if n exceeds available remaining songs, and null if there are no next songs.

Song* find(string artist)
Finds the next song played by the specified artist and plays it. If there are no remaining songs with the artist, return null and maintain the current song as is.

bool toggleFavorite()
Makes the current song a favorite if it is currently not set as favorite and returns true, otherwise unfavorites the song and returns false.

Song* remove()
Removes the current song from the list and returns the song if it exists; otherwise return null. The next song shall be marked as the current song, and when there is no next song, the previous song will be the current song.
